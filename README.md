# Interview-Questions
I'm preparing for interviews, so I'll be posting my solutions in this repository as I move forward.

This repository will cover questions that are very common in technical interviews along with the hard ones.

<b><a href="https://github.com/bootkernel/Interview-Questions/blob/master/swap.py">1) swap.py</b> = Write a program to swap values between two variables without using a temporary variable.</a>

<b><a href="https://github.com/bootkernel/Interview-Questions/blob/master/reverse_linked_list.py">2) reverse_linked_list.py</b> = Reverse a given Linked List.</a>

<b><a href="#">2) crypto.py</b> = Write a simple cryptography program that interchanges all alphabets. For instance, if I say <b>"z xzg"</b>. The decrypted version will be <b>"a cat"</b> because, z = a, c = x and so on. You don't have to worry about the uppercase or lowercase.</a>
