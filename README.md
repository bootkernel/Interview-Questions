# Interview Questions Repository
I'm preparing for interviews, so I'll be posting my solutions in this repository as I move forward. This repository will cover questions that are very common in technical interviews along with the hard ones. I've created two sections: one will contain, <b>Programming and Algorithm Related Questions</b> and the other one will have, <b>Theory Related Questions</b>.

# Programming and Algorithm Related Questions
<b><a href="https://github.com/bootkernel/Interview-Questions/blob/master/swap.py">1) swap.py</a></b> - Write a program to swap values between two variables without using a temporary variable.

<b><a href="https://github.com/bootkernel/Interview-Questions/blob/master/reverse_linked_list.py">2) reverse_linked_list.py</a></b> - Reverse a given Linked List.

<b><a href="https://github.com/bootkernel/Interview-Questions/blob/master/crypto.py">3) crypto.py</a></b> - Write a cryptography program that interchanges all alphabets. For instance, if I say, <b>"z xzg"</b>, the decrypted version will be <b>"a cat"</b> because, z = a, c = x and so on. You don't have to worry about the uppercase or lowercase parameters.
