# Interview-Questions
I'm preparing for interviews, so I'll be posting my solutions in this repository as I move forward.

This repository will cover questions that are very common in technical interviews along with the hard ones.

<b>1) swap.py</b> = In this program I'm using XOR Gate to swap values instead of using a temporary variable. (Common Interview Question)
<b>1) reverse_linked_list.py</b> = In this program I'm reversing a linked list. (Common Interview Question)
